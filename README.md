# My First API *work in Progress*

I created an API that allows a user to enter a string, if the entry has a match then  content will be displayed. A user can see the name searched, age, a quote,from the 70s Philosopher Alan Watts, and an image.This Web Application has three different endpoints, each directs you to another html file with it's own css and js files.

The second endpoint can be accessed by adding:/tolle to the url, this takes you to a page containing quotes from Eckhart Tolle's book: The Power of Now. The last endpoint can be viewed by adding: /dube to the url, this leads you to a page with images containing quotes by the music reggae artist Lucky Dube.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, nodeJS

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, along with nodeJS to develop a full stack application.

## Lessons Learned:
By working with nodeJS I was able to run my own server for this API.

I learned how install figlet via the command line and use it for my server's 404 response.
