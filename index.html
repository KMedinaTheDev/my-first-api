      <li>The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.</li>
      <li>Never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel, for love is not ours to command.</li>
      <li>Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.</li>
      <li>I have realized that the past and future are real illusions, that they exist in the present, which is what there is and all there is.</li>
      <li>No valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now.</li>
      <li>But I'll tell you what hermits realize. If you go off into a far, far forest and get very quiet, you'll come to understand that you're connected with everything.</li>
      <li>Zen does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while one is peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes.</li>
      <li>Never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel, for love is not ours to command.</li>
      <li>Faith is a state of openness or trust.</li>
      <li>You and I are all as much continuous with the physical universe as a wave is continuous with the ocean.</li>
